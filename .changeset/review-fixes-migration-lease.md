Fixes from an independent review: a live lock an older Sponson holds on the legacy receipts branch is respected during migration (no concurrent apply, no lost receipt); the final receipt is written whenever the store's fencing allows it, even if lease renewals lagged; `list()` no longer drops scopes whose names differ only by case on macOS/Windows; Vercel `target: development` variables never trigger or wait on a deployment. The git store's own working clone is created with `mkdtemp` (owner-only, unpredictable name). A lock that cannot be released is retried and then reported in the run's warnings instead of being left behind silently.
